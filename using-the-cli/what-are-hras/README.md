# Human Readable Addresses

HRA or Human Readable Addresses are a built in service that allows you to choose a human readable name that maps to your wallet address.

So instead of long and hard to remember address string that looks like this:

```text
VDAxNmM1OGVkNmYyNzI2NzcyYjYzODRmMzJmMDkzODhjMTczNWI0NDFjZGM5ZTIz
```

You can have a nice easy to remember name of your choice - something like this:

```text
pacman.ax
```

In HRA the name is called a domain and you can map as many as you like to an address. When choosing a name you just have to follow these simple rules:

1. The name must be alphanumeric \(numbers and letters only\)
2. The minimum length is 1 and the maximum length is 20
3. It must end in `.ax`

Obviously if the name is already taken you won't be able to register it. Registering names is free but as it's a transaction there is still a fee \(currently 0.001 AXNT\)

You can choose to sell a domain or buy one from the list of domains up for sale. You can cancel a sell order if nobody has bought it yet.
